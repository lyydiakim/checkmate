            Our team is composed of six members who are studying computer
            science. We decided that, as college students, splitting receipts is
            often complicated and inefficient. We have been developing
            CheckMate$ as an AI-powered solution to this common problem.

            Our product is for people who dine out or shop in groups often and
            who frequently struggle to divide expenses without error. CheckMate
            is a web app that scans your receipt and does all the math for you.
            Our product makes splitting receipts efficient, accurate, and fun!
            <br />
            <br />
            How To Use:
            <br />
            Upload a photo of your receipt and let us know who you're splitting
            with. You'll be able to assign each splitter to their items, unless
            you want to split your bill evenly. You'll get itemized lists of
            everyone's personal expenses and share the however you like!
